# Initial Try

In `Try.java`, there is an `if-else if-else` statement that is partially set up. Can you fix it so that it works properly?

When you are done, the following output should be produced by the file:

```

```

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
