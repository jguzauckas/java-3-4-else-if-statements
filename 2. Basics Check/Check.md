# Basics Check

Create two integer variables that have a random integer between -10 and 10 assigned to them.

Use conditionals to print the following sentences when appropriate:
- `"## is greater than ## by ##"` (ex. `"5 is greater than -2 by 7"`)
- `"## is less than ## by ##"` (ex. `"-5 is less than 4 by 9"`)
- `"## is equal to ##"`

Obviously which one is printed is random, can you run it enough to see at least two of the options printed?

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
